## Python files:
*	svm_all_kernels.py : this python file runs all the parameter variations discussed in the report by the use of nested loops.
*	svm_one_kernel.py : contains the same SVM implementation of the above file, but lets the user choose his own desired kernel, gamma and C value.

## Datasets (csv files): 
* trainingSet.csv : contains 12,100 training examples
* mnist_train.csv : contains 60,000 training examples
* mnist_test.csv : contains the test set

## CMD files:
